Nanodegree project

The project should meet some specifications, "the required elements" such as:
--->min 4 images;
--->title text
--->regular p tag(text)
--->a logo

I wanted to add here some of the main resources that helped me the most in order to understand flex-box concept and be able to actually play with it.
